## Loading a dataset from wandb

You can automatically load a dataset from our wandb artifacts by using
the code `load_wandb_artifact` from rtvpy as illustrated below

``` python
from rtvpy import load_wandb_artifact

dataset = load_wandb_artifact(
    artifact_name='2021_year2_set.csv')

dataset.head(n=2)
```

## Downloading datasets

The example above does not store a copy of the dataset on your local
machine, if you would like a copy stored on your local machine, you can
specify the `download` parameter as showed

``` python
from rtvpy import load_wandb_artifact

dataset = load_wandb_artifact(
    artifact_name='2021_year2_set.csv', 
    download=True)

dataset.head(n=2)
```

## (down)Load from other accounts or/and projects

The code snippets above automatically attempt to load/download the
datasets from the ‘Risk Assessment’ project of the ‘analytics’ team. If
you would like to access a dataset from a difference team or/and
project, you can set `entity` and `project` parameters of the
`load_wandb_artifact()` function as showed below

``` python
from rtvpy.wandb_manager import load_wandb_artifact

dataset = load_wandb_artifact(
    entity='analytic',
    project='Risk Assessment',
    artifact_name='2021_year2_set.csv', 
    download=True)

dataset.head(n=2)
```

## All parameters

Below is the list of all parameters that you can modify to get desired
results

- `entity` (str): Your WandB username or team name.
- `project` (str): The WandB project name.
- `artifact_name` (str): The name of the artifact to download.
- `version` (str): The version of the artifact to download (default is
  ‘latest’).
- `download_dir` (str): The local directory to save the downloaded
  artifact (default is ‘artifacts’).
- `download` (bool): Whether to delete the downloaded artifacts folder
  after loading the data.
