setup guide.

### Step 1: Install `rtvpy`

You can install rtvpy from pypi.org by running:

  there are specific functions or examples provided.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that any dependencies required by `rtvpy` are
  also installed, which should be specified in `rtvpy`’s
  `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`.
