Using `dotenv` is an excellent way to securely manage environment
variables in your applications. Below is a quick guide on how to set it
up.

## Step 1: Install `dotenv`

First, install the `python-dotenv` package. This package loads
environment variables from a `.env` file into Python’s `os.environ`.

``` bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Step 2: Create a `.env` file

Create a file called `.env` in the root of your project directory. This
file will store environment variables in `KEY=VALUE` format.

**Example `.env` file:**

``` plaintext
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname
DEBUG=True
```

### Step 4: Use Environment Variables Securely

To avoid exposing sensitive data, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
so that it is not tracked by version control.

**Example `.gitignore` entry:**

``` plaintext
.env
```

### Additional Tips

- **Default Values**: You can provide default values if an environment
  variable is not found.

  ``` python
  debug = os.getenv("DEBUG", "False")  # Default to False if DEBUG is not set
  ```

- **Error Handling**: Ensure your code can handle missing environment
  variables gracefully, especially in production environments.

That’s it! Now you’re set up to manage environment variables securely
with `dotenv`.
